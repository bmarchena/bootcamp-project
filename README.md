# SaveDumbo (TTP Bootcamp Collaborative Project #1)

## Purpose
This is a website for our movement, SaveDumbo. SaveDumbo is dedicated to defending and nurturing the lives of African elephants, who too often are hunted for their tusks and flesh.

This project was designed to have our group collaborate using git commands, the command line, and Github itself. We were tasked to work on our own parts of the website and merge the committed portions to see the entire product. Thus, no one person teammate had to work on the entire site by himself!
