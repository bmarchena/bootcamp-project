            <p class="about-text">Established in the 1850's, Save Dumbo is a protector of elephants. Based in New York
                City in the United States, we provide the help elephants need through the donations given to us. The <a
                    href="facts.html">facts</a>
                about what elephants have went through in past history are tragic. Elephants have been a prime target of
                illegal hunting due to their husks having value in trade markets, therefore causing a decline of African
                Elephants from 1.3 million to 600,000 individuals between 1979 to 1987. On top of this fact, families
                had their social, competitive, and physiological functioning compromised after losing their matriarchs
                through poaching.
            </p>
            <p class="about-text">
                What we do is increase funding in the protection of elephants where poaching is happening such as Africa
                and Asia. By increasing security and employing more workers that patrol the wild in order to preserve
                wildlife, we can have more eyes and ears around areas where are common to hunt down elephants.
