    <p>Established in the 1850's, Save Dumbo is a protector of elephants. Based in New York City in the United States,
        we provide the help elephants need through the donations given to us. The <a href="facts.html">facts</a> about
        what elephants have went through in past history are tragic. Elephants have been a prime target of illegal
        hunting due to their husks having value in trade markets, therefore causing a decline of African Elephants from
        1.3 million to 600,000 individuals between 1979 to 1987. On top of this fact, families had their social,
        competitive, and physiological functioning compromised after losing their matriarchs through poaching.

        What we do is increase funding in the protection of elephants where poaching is happening such as Africa and
        Asia. By increasing security and employing more workers that patrol the wild in order to preserve wildlife, we
        can have more eyes and ears around areas where are common to hunt down elephants.</p>
